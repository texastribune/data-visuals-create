# Project checklist
This is a running list of things you should do before you launch any project on one of our apps pages. It's compiled by the data visuals team and uses markdown. It can then be copied and pasted into a MD file and put into [the project's repo](https://github.com/texastribune/redistricting-CD27/blob/master/checklist.md).
