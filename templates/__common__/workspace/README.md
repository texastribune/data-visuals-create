# Workspace for <<title>>

This is the directory for storing all of your analysis, production and raw data files. It's important to use this directory for these files (instead of `assets` or `data`) because it will keep them out of GitHub.

## How do I push my workspace files up so others can access them?

```sh
npm run workspace:push
```

## How do I get someone else's workspace files?

```sh
npm run workspace:pull
```

> This will only work if they've deployed them! If you're not seeing them after a pull, check with the other developer.
